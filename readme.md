## About Me
At the age of 28, I decided to make a career change, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire for new challenges. I needed a profession that would allow me to continuously develop myself and leverage my talent for finding errors. This led me to become a software tester, a role that has transformed my life.

## Why I Love Being a Software Tester
Being a software tester allows me to be the guardian of software quality. Testing provides endless opportunities to discover typos, logical errors, and functionalities that can be improved for better user experiences. One of the aspects I enjoy most is the ability to use my creativity. I am always looking for innovative ways to "break" software or explore unconventional usage scenarios.

Empathy plays a crucial role in my work as a tester. I always aim to view the software from various users’ perspectives to ensure it aligns with their needs. I’m also committed to supporting my team, so I take care to create well-structured, detailed test cases that make it straightforward for others to replicate the steps.
